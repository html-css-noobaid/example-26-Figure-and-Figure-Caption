		<h2>Types of Owls</h2>

		<h3>Barn Owl</h3>

		    The barn owl (Tyto alba) is the most widely 
		    distributed species of owl and one of the most 
		    widespread of all birds. It is also referred to as the
		    common barn owl, to distinguish it from other species 
		    in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two 
		    main lineages of living owls, the other being the 
		    typical owls (Strigidae). The barn owl is found almost 
		    everywhere in the world except polar and desert regions,
		    Asia north of the Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and
		    some Pacific islands.</p>

		<h3>Horned Owl</h3>
		<p><img src="images/horned_owl.jpg" alt="a horned owl"
		    width="220" height="310" align="right"/>
		    The American (North and South America) horned owls and
		    the Old World eagle-owls make up the genus Bubo, at least
		    as traditionally described. The genus name Bubo is Latin 
		    for the Eurasian eagle-owl. This genus, depending on 
                    definition, contains about one or two dozen species of 
		    typical owls (family Strigidae) and is found in many parts of the world.
		    Some of the largest living Strigiformes are in Bubo. Traditionally, only 
                    owls with ear-tufts were included in this genus, but that is no longer
                    the case.</p>

		<h3>True Owl</h3>
		<p><img src="images/true_owl.jpg" alt="a true owl"
	            width="220" height="310" align="top"/>
		    The true owls or typical owls (family Strigidae) are one
 		    of the two generally accepted families of owls, the other
		    being the barn owls (Tytonidae). The Sibley-Ahlquist 
		    taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order;
		    here, the typical owls are a subfamily Striginae. This is
		    unsupported by more recent research (see Cypselomorphae
		    for details), but the relationships of the owls in general 
		    are still unresolved. This large family comprises around
                    189 living species in 25 genera. The typical owls have a 
                    cosmopolitan distribution and are found on every continent
                    except Antarctica.</p>

		<h3>Screech Owl</h3>
		<p><img src="images/screech_owl.jpg" alt="a screech owl"
		    width="220" height="310" align="middle"/>
		    Screech owls or screech-owls are typical owls (Strigidae) belonging
		    to the genus Megascops. Twenty-one living species are known
		    at present, but new ones are frequently recognized and unknown 
                    ones are still being discovered on a regular basis, especially
		    in the Andes. For most of the 20th century, this genus was merged
	            with the Old World scops owls in Otus, but nowadays it is again 
		    considered separate based on a range of behavioral, biogeographical, 
		    morphological and DNA sequence data. Screech owls are restricted
		    to the Americas. Some species formerly placed with them are
		    nowadays considered more distinct (see below for details). 
		    The common name "screech owl" is sometimes used for the
                    not closely related barn owl as well.</p>

		<h3>Northern White-Faced Owl</h3>
		<p><img src="images/northern_white_faced_owl.jpg" alt="a northern white faced owl"
		    width="220" height="310" align="bottom"/>
		    The northern white-faced owl (Ptilopsis leucotis) is a species 
		    of owl in the family Strigidae. The southern white-faced owl 
                    (P. granti) was formerly included in this species and the two 
                    were known as the white-faced scops-owl.It is found in a band
		    across Africa between the Sahara and the Equator. It occurs in
                    Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, 
                    Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, 
                    Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, 
                    Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo and Uganda.</p>
